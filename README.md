# NanoDuck Consulting Group

A simpler, private, mobile-first browser product for genuine consultant and Critic discussion, live research and practical decisions.

**Electric A v8 is approved and production implementation is in progress.** The application includes browser UI, server routes, Google-owner authentication wiring, encrypted MySQL persistence, consultation orchestration and a controlled Codex app-server adapter. The named GoDaddy app now tracks this repository; no GoDaddy secret, database, preview update or publication has occurred.

## Run the application locally

Requires Node.js 22 or newer.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [NanoDuck locally](http://127.0.0.1:3000/). Development mode exposes a local-only owner sign-in. Production mode requires a configured verified Google owner identity, HTTPS origin, a MySQL connection with certificate verification, separate data/recovery/session keys, and protected Codex app-server authentication. GoDaddy supplies the connection as `DB_*` values; other hosts can supply `DATABASE_URL` and an optional private CA file. Use [`.env.example`](.env.example) to see variable names; do not commit values.

### Bootstrap the owner instruction document

The consultant instruction document is never kept in this repository. On a fresh database, supply it once as either UTF-8/base64url Markdown in `RUNTIME_INSTRUCTIONS_BOOTSTRAP_B64` or gzip/base64url Markdown in `RUNTIME_INSTRUCTIONS_BOOTSTRAP_GZIP_B64`; set only one. Production `npm start` applies the idempotent migration before serving; it validates and encrypts the document, then writes the first saved version. Remove that bootstrap secret from the deployment environment afterwards. Every later review, edit and restore happens through authenticated Settings and the database.

Before connecting a target runtime, supply Codex `auth.json` either through `CODEX_APP_SERVER_AUTH_PATH` (a mounted private file) or `CODEX_APP_SERVER_AUTH_B64` (the same bytes, base64url-encoded in the host secret store), then run `npm run preflight`. The app creates the file only inside an owned, removed-after-use app-server directory. It performs only the managed Codex account, model-catalog and rate-limit inspection; it does not start a model turn, contact MySQL or change GoDaddy.

The owner selected Electric and requested colours from [HappyPro Academy](https://happypro.academy/): its blue and large-heading gradient, with warmer yellow Head Consultant, raspberry Critic, violet Product and turquoise Operations. The black Ember/Cobalt composition and behavior stay the same.

[Download the SVG logo](forge/design/candidates/a/v8/nanoduck.svg). The dark-interface mark appears in navigation, sign-in and the favicon. [Original charcoal-outline SVG](forge/design/candidates/a/v8/nanoduck-original.svg) is also included.

[The review page](http://127.0.0.1:4328/comparison/) preserves the selected palette and links to the unchosen Solar/Prismatic references. Earlier v1–v7 files and receipts remain unchanged. This revision makes all nine node radii equal and separates the upper coloured segments by a clear gap; the complete Electric A v8 was explicitly approved on 14 September 2026. See [current verification](docs/verification.md).

The implemented app uses a floating desktop menu, mobile hamburger, literal Settings, model and reasoning selectors, icon-only microphone and a visible Send button. New sits above the workspace and remains available in Conversations; it is absent from global menus. Discussion, Outcome and Sources show persisted consultation events rather than fixtures.

The app enforces an absolute 24-hour session from sign-in, including inactivity and browser reopening, with immediate sign-out/revocation/security exceptions. A discussion is accepted durably before orchestration begins. Voice input uses the native recognition API available in Safari and Chrome; Ukrainian uses the browser's Ukrainian locale (`uk-UA`). Speech can be processed by the browser's recognition service only after Start. NanoDuck receives no audio: it inserts only editable text into the local draft, and Send remains separate.

The original green design in `prototype/` is rejected historical evidence. It is not an approved baseline. The canonical baseline and approval receipt are in the design brief.

```sh
npm run check
```

The source repository is public; the intended application remains private to one owner. Do not add private conversation archives, provider grants, secrets or deployment data to Git. Production startup applies the idempotent migration only to `nanoduck_*` tables after the deployment target's database ownership is verified; `npm run migrate` remains available for an explicit operator run.

Recovery is an operator-only, explicit command. `npm run recovery -- backup <new-encrypted-file>` creates a new encrypted recovery envelope with the separate recovery key. `npm run recovery -- restore <encrypted-file> --confirm-restore` requires an explicit destructive confirmation and applies deletion tombstones before records, so a deleted conversation cannot return. Neither command has been run against GoDaddy or any live database.
