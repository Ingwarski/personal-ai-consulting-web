# NanoDuck Consulting Group — Electric design

14 September 2026 · Codex design executor · Electric A v8 approved; canonical baseline below

## Source references and design source material inventory

The owner rejected the prior green editorial candidate and requested a modern, bold comparison with floating desktop navigation, mobile hamburger, literal Settings, model/reasoning selection and voice. Those decisions are reflected in the current PRD and structural documents. The prior slogan and Your space label are rejected copy. Existing materials have already been supplied; no further upload or brand interview is required.

Required sources are available. The previous prototype is avoidance evidence only; that rejected system supplies no visual authority; the subsequently approved Electric A v8 is recorded below. The local model catalog is a content-free read of model/list, not deployed preferences or execution entitlement. External references are read-only guidance, not assets or required network dependencies.

## Product experience goal

Let the owner follow an intelligent discussion, challenge a claim and make a deliberate next move. Boldness belongs in navigation, topic hierarchy, speaker identity and a clear Critic contribution. Long-form discussion remains calm and legible. Avoid slogans that do not help a task, decorative AI glow, theatrical human portraits and integration status walls.

## Design brief and decision log

| Decision | Basis and consequence |
|---|---|
| Combined layout | Latest owner revision: Ember black theme, avatar/message formatting and local tabs inside Cobalt centered chat/composer geometry. Subsequently accepted explicitly as Electric A v8. |
| Brand identity | Owner-requested NanoDuck Consulting Group. Use the owner-supplied thin-outline duck mark, with its yellow and warm-red head/bill accents. Reconstruct it as vector paths and round nodes; do not substitute the earlier filled blue duck. On dark surfaces use a light outline; retain a separate original charcoal-outline SVG for light surfaces. Two-line wordmark keeps the full name visible on mobile. Apply the mark in floating navigation, sign-in and favicon. Decorative mark beside readable name has empty alt; the navigation control retains its explicit accessible name. No external image/font requests. |
| Warmer yellow | Latest owner correction replaces the previous lemony Head yellow with the warmer Head token below; this affects Head Consultant only; the supplied logo retains its own yellow-to-red accents. |
| Selected Electric refinement | Owner selected Electric and requested HappyPro blue for the main heading/important accents, raspberry Critic and clear yellow Head Consultant. Product violet and Operations turquoise complete the palette. Layout and behavior stay the same. |
| Unchosen Solar reference | Preserved gold/coral/lilac and rose comparison reference. It is not the selected product direction. |
| Unchosen Prismatic reference | Preserved gold/cyan/lavender and orchid comparison reference. It is not the selected product direction. |
| Conventional floating navigation | Discussion, Conversations and Settings on desktop; labelled hamburger on mobile. New is outside these menus, in the workspace action row and Conversations. |
| Settings controls | Independent model/reasoning controls, optional Critic provider and a visible full-height editable runtime-instructions Markdown document from encrypted database storage, with current revision/status and a compact saved-version list. Review opens a read-only dialog; Restore is explicit and creates a new current revision. Each save or restore affects only the next run; malformed required headings/placeholders or a stale revision show a specific local error. |
| Composer | Cobalt width and sticky geometry; an unmistakable inline SVG microphone with accessible name, image-attachment action and a bright Send button that cannot shrink or become transparent. |
| Scoped implementation correction | Owner requested that their runtime messages show `You` in the header with `I` in the avatar, and that the voice action use a recognizable microphone icon. This is a presentation-only correction to the local implementation; the frozen Electric A v8 candidate remains immutable approval history. |
| Review controls | State and locale fixtures appear only in an explicit inspection URL, outside the normal preview; no Review states control exists in the app. Palette comparison belongs to the external review shell. |
| Session access | PRD owns the 24-hour app session. A concise Settings description may explain it; this prototype does not authenticate or prove elapsed-time persistence. |
| Version history | Original Cobalt/Ember/Prism versions remain frozen history. Combined v3 remains frozen. Electric v4 remains frozen. Branded Electric v5 remains frozen with the superseded drawn logo. Electric v6 remains frozen as a rejected first reconstruction. Electric v7 remains frozen; v8 makes every node radius equal and separates the coloured crown segments; equivalent-scope unchosen references remain available for comparison history. |

Electric, Solar and Prismatic are design labels; NanoDuck Consulting Group is the owner-confirmed product name. Electric was selected by the user; the complete Electric A v8 was explicitly accepted on 14 September 2026. This is styling only: no changed roles, privileges, data exposure, integrations or security obligations.

## Design spine

Token proposals are recorded once here. Individual candidate styles consume these roles and may add named local component tokens within their immutable version. System font stacks avoid external font downloads or uncertain provenance.

| Shared token | Current proposal |
|---|---|
| Canvas / surfaces | `#101114` / `#18191f`; floating bar and composer use near-black surfaces. |
| Body / muted / separators | `#f5f5f7` / `#b4b4bb` / `#3b3c45`. |
| Electric primary action / hover / foreground | HappyPro `#2e6fdc` / `#1f5fc5` / `#ffffff`; Send and other filled actions use the same blue. |
| Electric large page heading | HappyPro gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #dceeff 0%, #8bb8f4 32%, #2e6fdc 66%, #1f5fc5 100%)`; restricted to large headings on the black canvas. |
| Electric small accent / focus | `#8bb8f4`, the HappyPro gradient tint, for small text and focus rings; exact primary blue supplies structural borders and the selected-tab underline. |
| Electric supporting accents | Citation/Outcome surfaces `#142034` / `#151f30`, border `#355483`; agent-avatar text `#151114`. |
| Unchosen reference action | Solar/Prismatic retain their original `#ffb36b` action with `#151114` text as historical comparison treatments. |
| Chat/composer | Centered 950px reading column and sticky composer from Cobalt; one column on phones. |
| Message format | Ember avatar plus content grid: 38px avatar, 16px gap, role/time/recipient header, neutral 16px message body at 1.65 line-height. Owner entries and recipient labels render `You`, and owner entries use `I` in the avatar while retaining the internal owner identity. No wide speaker rail or filled owner card. |
| Local tabs | Ember transparent tabs, plain counts, muted inactive text and active accent with a 3px underline; keyboard/ARIA behavior retained. |
| Targets and shapes | 44px minimum primary controls; Send at least 48px high and 100px wide; input 16px; 4/8/12/16/24/32px spacing. |

| Role | Selected Electric v8 | Unchosen Solar | Unchosen Prismatic |
|---|---|---|---|
| You | `#bbc7dd` | `#d9d4cb` | `#ced1e0` |
| Head | `#ffd45a` | `#ffc166` | `#e4c66b` |
| Product | `#b39aff` | `#ff9470` | `#7fdee2` |
| Operations | `#5bd8cd` | `#d0b1ff` | `#bdb0ff` |
| Critic | `#ea4779` | `#ff7f95` | `#ef97ea` |

Use role colour on names, avatar fills and restrained quote/edge accents; keep written role names and dark avatar initials. Critic retains a distinct left border. Colour alone never identifies a role. Electric role-text contrast against the dark surface is at least 4.74:1; white button text against primary blue is 4.75:1. The darkest heading-gradient stop is 3.15:1 against the canvas, suitable only for large heading text; smaller text uses the light-blue accent. Other headings on raised surfaces use that light tint. These are limited token calculations, not full accessibility conformance. Forced-colors mode restores system-colour text without the gradient. No production palette-setting feature is introduced. The supplied duck uses charcoal `#424242` linework in the original/light-surface variant, light `#f5f5f7` linework on the dark interface, and head/bill accents `#e3c640` and `#da6849`. The source is a 100px JPEG; this is a manual vector reconstruction of its visible geometry, not a claim to recover an original vector master. Preserve the open body with a semicircular lower contour, short tail with a tight corner, and straight upright neck. The neck-to-right-tip and crown-to-bill turns are square, not rounded. Include only the five dark endpoint nodes and four coloured nodes visible in the source; no node at the tail/neck intersection or along the intermediate crown segments. The owner rejected v6 for invented nodes and inaccurate curve rounding; v7 follows an enlarged-source inspection. The next explicit owner correction requires every one of the nine nodes to use radius 2.5 SVG units. Yellow and orange crown segments are separate paths with no connecting stroke: their upper nodes are centred at (56.5, 23.5) and (64.5, 23.5), leaving a 3-unit clear gap between the circle edges. Apply this geometry identically to both logo variants. Neither the Head role token nor HappyPro blue recolours this brand mark. The mark occupies 40px in navigation (36px on mobile); the wordmark remains two readable lines without hiding Consulting Group.

## Experience spine

Use the canonical screen-map inventory and wireframe recovery contract. Navigation identifies the active destination; mobile menus close on selection/Escape and return focus. Native labelled selects make model and reasoning options recognizable. If a model change invalidates the selected effort, require a deliberate compatible choice rather than silently downgrading it. Unsupported Claude catalog state is contextual and does not interrupt the default Codex route.

The composer offers text, owner-generated image attachment and voice without hiding voice in Settings. The approved presentation already includes this attachment control, so the JPEG/PNG/WebP-only runtime rule does not alter the Electric A v8 visual baseline. Ordinary progress uses one quiet line. An active consultation always exposes Stop within reach. A browser-recognized transcript never silently becomes a sent message; Use transcript inserts editable text and explicit Send remains separate. Preserve existing typed text during voice failure/cancel. Browser-native recognition and its disclosure are runtime behavior specified by the PRD; they do not alter the approved Electric A v8 visual baseline.

Dialogs have a name, visible close/cancel, focus containment and return. Confirmation identifies the exact record. Sign-in and first-use consent are separate; consent is unchecked. Sources expose a direct link, supported claim and limit; sample references never claim a fresh research run. Outcome and full discussion remain separate views.

All candidate UI is explicitly labelled as a design preview with fictional content. Preview state and locale controls are hidden from normal review and available only through a dedicated inspection URL; they are absent from production. New occupies their former position above the chat. No real microphone, authentication, network generation, private-data persistence or deployment behavior is implemented. Fixtures cover English and Ukrainian conversation/transcript content; role labels remain English. Mobile is one column; all candidates are compared at 320/390/430/768/1280/1440 CSS px. Reduced-motion and forced-colors behavior preserve textual state. Do not depend on animation, sound, color, hover or voice alone.

## Heuristic review plan

Scope is the existing owner, all JOBs/UCs and J-01–J-07 as mapped by the screen inventory, at mobile and desktop widths. Each row defines planned coverage. The [recorded v1 heuristic review](../forge/design/evidence/heuristic-review.json) contains an executed H1–H10 prototype walkthrough and closed findings. It is later review evidence, not representative-user validation or a pass of every formal QA check. Actual findings belong to QA evidence, with P0–P3 severity and separate blocking/advisory effect.

| Heuristic | Scope and expected behavior | Planned evidence |
|---|---|---|
| H1 — Status | S-02/S-04/S-05/S-08: accepted vs draft, active/paused, browser recognition/transcript, saved/deleted are explicit. | Stateful walkthrough and screenshots. |
| H2 — Real-world language | All surfaces: literal Settings; role/claim/action wording; no vague slogan or transport jargon. | English/Ukrainian fixture review. |
| H3 — Control | S-02/S-05/S-08/S-09: Stop, Cancel, edit, Back and safe menu/dialog exit. | Keyboard/touch recovery walkthrough. |
| H4 — Standards | S-04/S-09 and global: native fields, conventional navigation, focus and current state. | Cross-candidate desktop/mobile comparison. |
| H5 — Prevention | S-01/S-04/S-05/S-08: unchecked consent, valid choices, no automatic send, deletion confirmation. | Invalid/repeat-click/cancel paths. |
| H6 — Recognition | S-02/S-03/S-04/S-06: visible selected model/effort, context, titles and source meanings. | Return-to-work task review. |
| H7 — Efficiency | Simple entry plus visible mic; persistent navigation; Settings is optional. No unrequested bulk tools or shortcut scheme. | Novice and repeated-use paths; keyboard alternatives. |
| H8 — Minimalism | All surfaces: bold hierarchy supports actual content; no nested decorative card stacks or routine service paragraphs. | First viewport and long-content captures. |
| H9 — Recovery | All error states from the wireframe table preserve work and show a relevant next step. | Denial, offline, quota, research and voice failure walkthroughs. |
| H10 — Contextual help | S-01/S-04/S-05/S-06: brief processing/voice explanation, invalid-choice help and source limitation. No generic help dump. | Error/first-use comprehension review. |

## Usability validation plan

Representative group: the existing owner, on a phone and desktop. Tasks: dictate and correct a request without accidental send (JOB-006/UC-006); identify the Critic objection and response and inspect its source (JOB-001/UC-002/UC-007); change future reasoning while retaining active settings (JOB-003/UC-005); stop/recover/export and cancel deletion (JOB-002/JOB-004/UC-003/UC-004). Success means completing each task without moderator rescue, unintended action or loss of accepted work; record observed difficulties rather than inventing a pass.

No representative-user session has been conducted. Pre-approval observation is desirable for novel voice/control behavior but is deferred to owner availability; the risk is an attractive candidate with misunderstood capture or state controls. Owner: product owner with the design reviewer. Timing: owner comparison when available, then required post-implementation task validation before release. This deferral is not approval or a release pass.

## Approved Visual Baseline

Status: approved. Baseline ID: `nanoduck-electric-a-v8-20260914`. Selected candidate: **Electric A v8**, candidate set `web-nanoduck-equal-nodes-20260913`. Origin: Codex integrated Ember/Cobalt composition and vector reconstruction of the owner-supplied logo. This is the first approved replacement baseline; v1–v7 and unchosen B/C remain immutable history.

- Durable visual target: `forge/design/candidates/a/v8/index.html`; SHA-256 `93231814431a1bbbf8a0ba07f515eefcfd63193534189898b70766ed45938cbc`.
- Frozen source root: `forge/design/candidates/a/v8`; tree hash `1de020dcfe48f3feb80db0e58ba911b821825b48730d32c72d9518ad512eb0d9`; algorithm `sdd-tree-sha256-v1`; render dependencies: none outside that root.
- Approval: [owner receipt](../forge/design/evidence/electric-v8-approval-20260914.json), event `approve_design_baseline`, recorded 2026-09-13T21:34:53.939214+00:00. Exact approval quote: “OK. Design accepted.” The receipt time is the recording time in this active turn; the transport did not provide an exact message timestamp.
- Whole-product scope: JOB-001–JOB-006; UC-001–UC-007; J-01–J-07; S-01–S-09; ST-01–ST-44; English/Ukrainian fixtures; 320, 390, 430, 768, 1280 and 1440 CSS px design coverage. Scope is an obligation, not evidence that every combination was observed. Current v8 receipts record the narrower actual observations and inherited evidence limits.
- Presentation authority: black theme, Ember messages/local tabs, Cobalt geometry, the Electric tokens in the Design spine, NanoDuck identity and both corrected SVG exports. All nine nodes have radius 2.5; the yellow/orange crown paths have a 3-unit clear gap. The original JPEG remains a reference, not a recovered vector master.
- Permitted variance: replace fictional task content and simulated state handlers with real data and functioning services; remove candidate/version/comparison/inspection scaffolding from production; preserve semantic roles, hierarchy, layout, tokens, visible controls and navigation. Browser font rasterization, content-driven wrapping, safe-area insets and required accessible states may vary without redesign. Any material visual, flow or token change returns to the design owner and requires an explicit accepted revision; no unrecorded overrides.
- No production behavior, provider entitlement, representative-user task completion, WCAG conformance or release readiness is approved by this event. Prototype evidence stays scoped; all formal implementation checks remain unrun.

## Validation report and open questions

Mechanical review: nine surfaces and all screen-map states resolve to the seven use cases; tokens and component/recovery rules resolve; source inventory is available; heuristic and user-validation plans are separate. No blocking document-coverage finding.

Judgment review: the owner selected Electric and requested the HappyPro blue, raspberry and yellow refinement; both earlier comparison rounds remain historical. The recorded v1 comparison resolved its reported layout/control findings within the inspected prototype scope. Whole-design acceptance is recorded below. Representative-owner task completion remains unobserved, and later revisions require evidence matched to their exact source and rendering identity. Runtime, live catalog/entitlement and host compatibility remain implementation evidence, not visual-approval prerequisites.
