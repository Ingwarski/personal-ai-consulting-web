# NanoDuck Consulting Group

Current product brief · 14 September 2026 · Browser replacement · Revision 7

## Product identity

The owner named this browser replacement **NanoDuck Consulting Group** and requested an SVG logo. Use that exact name in the app. Electric remains the selected design direction, with the previously requested HappyPro blue and raspberry Critic. The latest correction asks for a slightly warmer Head Consultant yellow. The existing GoDaddy app retains its historical name for exact deployment targeting; this rename does not change that boundary or authorize deployment.

## Purpose

A private web app where one owner works through a business or personal decision with a Head Consultant, relevant specialist consultants and a separate Critic. Open a browser, sign in, describe the situation, follow a substantive discussion and leave with a practical next step.

The product succeeds when the owner makes a better decision with less effort. Operating integrations, reading procedural announcements and troubleshooting the messenger are not part of that job.

## Authority and scope of this reset

The owner's eight-part request on 13 September 2026 replaces the messenger channel, connection-heavy daily workflow and previous visual design. Their follow-up explicitly selected **review, product brief and design first**. The next correction required three modern, bold alternatives using the SDD pipeline, floating desktop navigation with a mobile hamburger menu, the literal label Settings, working model/reasoning selectors and voice input. The owner later explicitly authorized Phase 3. This revision implements the browser-native voice-input boundary in the replacement checkout; deployment and GoDaddy data deletion remain outside that authorization.

This is a new current brief, not another amendment layered onto the old one. It supersedes the old brief for this replacement repository. Previous approvals of the Matrix interface do not approve the new design. Preserved capabilities below come from the existing product and code review; the replacement visual design has now been adopted as described below; architecture remains authoritative for the remaining implementation and release work.

The source code repository is public. The deployed product, account, conversations, attachments and provider credentials remain private. Public source availability does not create a multiuser service or authorize publication of the owner's history.

## User, problem and desired outcome

The primary user is the existing single owner, working across phone, tablet and desktop, sometimes returning after an interruption. They need informed advice and constructive challenge without becoming the system operator each time they use it.

Their reported problems are excessive weak points, robotic conversation, too much service wording, repeated connection settings and an unsatisfactory interface. Source review confirms substantial Matrix transport machinery, formal proposal-review loops and research gated by request wording. It does not establish the cause of every production incident.

## Jobs

| Job | Situation and desired progress | Observable success | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| JOB-001 — Reach a decision | When a business or personal question needs judgment, get relevant expertise and challenge so I can choose a practical action. Current alternative: the existing messenger consultation. | A clear recommendation or a clearly bounded unresolved question, with evidence, risks and up to three next actions. | Retained product intent; confirmed. |
| JOB-002 — Follow and steer | When consultants work on my question, see their actual contributions, add context and stop or resume the work. | I can identify the disagreement, see a response or revision, and interrupt without losing accepted messages. | Existing control requirements and current request; confirmed. |
| JOB-003 — Keep my preferences | When I return on any device, use the existing models and settings without reconnecting integrations. | Sign-in leads to a usable conversation; active runs keep their exact settings. | Current request; confirmed. |
| JOB-004 — Return to the record | When I revisit a decision, recover the complete conversation and sources, and control its retention. | Open, export or delete a complete saved conversation; a reconnect does not duplicate replies. | Retained history/control requirements; confirmed. |
| JOB-006 — Capture a thought | When typing on a phone is inconvenient, dictate a thought, review its transcript and choose what to send. Current alternative: type the whole request. | Start/stop/cancel browser recognition; edit the transcript before sending; retain the existing typed draft when permission or recognition fails. | Explicit owner correction; confirmed. |
| JOB-005 — Understand limits | When a provider limit affects work, know what is available and what action is needed. | Real quota/reset information where available; no invented per-session charge or connection warning for an unused provider. | Retained usage truth and simplified daily workflow; confirmed. |

These jobs map to the start/consult/steer/revisit/account workflow below. The PRD owns formal use-case mapping; the development plan owns implementation mapping after design approval.

## Everyday workflow

1. **Sign in.** Use the existing Google owner identity. A returning owner opens the latest conversation or starts a new one. No messenger, browser extension, installation or connection checklist.
2. **Describe the situation.** Write naturally, dictate using the microphone, or optionally attach an image generated by the owner. V1 accepts only raster images; it does not accept PDF. Voice creates an editable transcript before sending; recording never starts automatically. Head asks one material question only if its answer can change the recommendation. Preserve the optional focused interview: usually 1–3 questions, maximum five, one at a time, with a suggested answer or explicit assumption available.
3. **Work through the question.** A simple question gets a direct answer. A substantive consultation uses separate specialist agent contexts, different assignments and a separate Critic. An explicit request for Critic or a team is honored. The owner sees complete, addressed contributions as they are confirmed and can add context or stop.
4. **Check evidence.** The team researches current claims when needed, without requiring the owner to ask for a special research mode. Sources are linked beside relevant claims and available together for inspection.
5. **Act and revisit.** Head gives a self-contained conclusion, up to three practical actions, the main risk and a condition for revisiting the decision. Continue with the same context, start a new consultation or return later through history.

## What real discussion means

- Each participating consultant and Critic is a separately invoked AI agent/context. A single completion labelled with several roles is not a consilium.
- The owner chooses the number of relevant specialists for a substantive team consultation: 1, 2, 3, 5 or Auto. The count excludes Head Consultant and Critic. In Auto, Head selects the smallest useful team from one through five; each receives distinct work and the entire pool is never launched by default.
- Start from independent positions, then exchange specific claims, objections, questions, evidence and revisions. Critic challenges the material weakness; the relevant consultant answers that challenge. Agreement is allowed immediately when warranted. Do not manufacture conflict or praise.
- Each ordinary reply should develop one useful point. A proposed writing target is 60–140 words, with longer calculations or explanations when necessary. This guides generation; it is not permission to truncate or rewrite an actual submitted message.
- Display the full submitted business messages in canonical order, with role, addressed recipient when relevant and time. Hidden model reasoning, credentials and technical tool logs are not conversation content.
- Keep version/approval bookkeeping internal. Use the word **consensus** only when all participating specialists, Critic and Head actually agree on the same current recommendation. If agreement is not reached, deliver an explicitly provisional conclusion with unresolved disagreement and the next evidence needed.
- The owner chooses discussion depth as 1, 3, 5 or Auto complete Critic ↔ specialist exchanges. In Auto, stop when the consilium reaches a supported recommendation or bounded uncertainty, never after more than 10 exchanges. Explicit depth is not permission for ceremonial filler. Preserve Stop and bounded use of subscriptions.
- Role names remain in English. Product messages and source metadata support English and Ukrainian only; reject Russian and Belarusian language or terminology. The first substantive request sets the session language; an explicit supported-language request wins. Do not switch language because of a citation or image attachment.

## Research is part of consulting

Live public-web research is available to the consultation team by default. Use it for time-sensitive facts, cited resources, specialist uncertainty or evidence that can change a recommendation. Do not make every answer browse needlessly.

Record source title, direct URL, the claim it supports, retrieval time and publication date when available. Use only English or Ukrainian sources. Reject Russian and Belarusian sources, terminology and URLs, including `.ru`, `.by`, `.su` and their Cyrillic equivalents. Distinguish retrieved fact, owner-supplied information, assumptions and professional judgment. Sources can disagree or fail; show that honestly. Never invent a citation or describe cached knowledge as a fresh check.

Preserve the existing Codex live-search capability. A selected Claude Critic must be able to request a targeted check and receive the resulting evidence through the team; its current adapter is tool-free, so direct Claude browsing is not assumed. Research does not silently change the selected LLM or enable paid fallback.

Use public, minimized queries. Do not send private business details or attachment contents to search services without specific authorization. Retrieved pages provide evidence, not instructions or permission to act.

## Login and preferences

Normal use requires only owner sign-in. A normal app session remains valid for 24 hours from successful sign-in, including inactivity and closing/reopening the browser. Explicit sign-out, owner/operator revocation or security invalidation can end it sooner; the 24-hour boundary requires sign-in again. This is an app-access lifetime, distinct from a consultation run or provider grant. Provider grants are provisioned once for the deployment and refreshed automatically where supported. Model discovery and infrastructure diagnostics are operational responsibilities, outside the everyday settings journey.

Use the literal navigation label **Settings**. Provide working model selection and reasoning-strength selection independently for Head/specialists and Critic, preserve the optional Critic provider choice, and include number of specialists (1, 2, 3, 5 or Auto), discussion depth (1, 3, 5 or Auto), usage facts and sign-out. Populate choices from the current supported catalog; do not hide these controls behind read-only summaries. Changes affect future runs; active runs preserve their exact snapshot. No Matrix setup, device verification, room IDs, storage probes, catalog-refresh buttons or generic integration gallery.

App login cannot create a ChatGPT/Claude subscription grant. If the selected provider truly requires reauthorization, show one contextual action beside the paused conversation and return to the same work afterward. A quota limit shows known reset information; a transient outage gets retry behavior. Do not ask the owner to reconnect for an unrelated failure or warn about an inactive Claude route.

## Models and settings to preserve

| Role/setting | Last recorded selection | Evidence status |
|---|---|---|
| Head and specialists | Codex, `gpt-6-astra`, `xhigh` | Existing repository's live-review record dated 7 September 2026. |
| Critic | Codex, `gpt-6-astra`, `xhigh` | Current authenticated settings read on 14 September 2026; the old screen's catalog was stale/unavailable, but its saved raw value was exact. |
| Legacy orchestration preset | Balanced (`збалансовано`) | Historical GoDaddy observation only; it did not expose the new separate specialist-count and discussion-depth choices. |
| Optional Critic route | Claude Code, preserving its separately saved model/effort if selected | Supported in current system; saved inactive values not established by this review. |

A current content-free read confirms the active Codex settings above. The inactive Claude branch remains unknown and must not be replaced with defaults. Independently verify each exact active provider/model/effort combination before cutover; Astra/xhigh catalog evidence alone is not an execution proof.

Preserve subscription use, no silent model/effort substitution, no API-key/PAYG fallback, no automatic usage credits and no Claude Fast Mode. Current provider package pins are Codex `0.153.1` and Claude Code `2.1.258`; this implementation stores independent specialist-count and discussion-depth choices, defaults to 2 specialists and 1 exchange, and retains a 540,000 ms provider budget. Model settings and orchestration limits are separate concerns.

## V1 boundary

**Included:** a private responsive web app; existing owner Google sign-in without an app-specific MFA step; one active consultation; direct answers and substantive team discussion; a bounded specialist pool; text, voice input and owner-generated raster-image attachments; live research; complete conversation history; export and whole-conversation deletion; Stop, Continue and New consultation; optional model/effort/provider, specialist-count and discussion-depth preferences; truthful quota/usage information; recovery across browser interruptions and server restart.

The permitted specialist pool covers strategy, finance, operations, entrepreneurship, B2B/B2C sales, marketing, product, data and risk, plus Spiritual Consultant and Psychotherapist. Leadership Consultant and esoteric roles are excluded. Spiritual Consultant works from evangelical Protestant doctrine: Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, His finished work, salvation by faith alone and salvation that cannot be lost. Psychotherapist may draw on major classical psychotherapy schools and Internal Family Systems. These are AI roles, not claims of human employment or professional licensure. Psychotherapist does not diagnose, replace clinical care or handle an emergency without directing the owner to immediate local help. Existing high-stakes and explicit external-action boundaries remain.

**Excluded:** Matrix/Element and other messengers, public registration, multiuser SaaS, payments, additional hosts or paid research services by default, automatic external actions, required browser notifications, native mobile apps, PDF/SVG/video/archive attachments, arbitrary file uploads and restoration of the rejected design.

**Voice input:** microphone input is required in V1. Safari and Chrome use their built-in speech-recognition capability with `uk-UA` for Ukrainian; no recording is uploaded to, stored by or transcribed by NanoDuck. The owner explicitly starts recognition, sees its active state, can Stop or Cancel, then reviews editable text before a separate Send. The voice dialog says that the browser's recognition service may process speech. Permission denial, unavailable browser support, disabled service, network failure and interruption preserve the typed draft and offer retry or typing. Do not listen or recognize in the background. Video and arbitrary file types are not added.

## Privacy, ownership and recovery

HTTPS protects the browser-to-server connection; the application server and selected model providers process the content. Do not call the replacement Matrix-style end-to-end encrypted. Retain conversations and their attachments encrypted without a time limit, until the owner explicitly deletes them. Provider credentials also need protected server storage, with keys separated from stored data and a tested restore path.

Image attachments are a single-owner convenience, not a public file-exchange feature. The owner stated that they will upload only images they generated; the application cannot technically attest that provenance. It accepts only bounded raster images and never treats them as executable content. PDF is deliberately out of scope. If another user, externally sourced images or any new file type becomes allowed, return to the PRD security review before implementation.

Keep one concise initial explanation/consent for ordinary AI processing, existing minimization and specific permission for sensitive transfers. Voice has a separate, just-in-time browser permission and disclosure because its recognition service can receive speech; NanoDuck receives only text the owner chooses to insert and send. Do not repeatedly ask for unchanged permission. Keep secrets and prohibited sensitive records out of agent messages, logs and the public repository.

An accepted message survives refresh/restart. Unsent drafts remain clearly distinct from accepted work. Reconnecting resumes the saved conversation and does not insert a second copy of an already confirmed reply. Stop prevents late work from becoming a new visible result. A failed research/provider step preserves the record and reports the actual limitation.

## Success and release evidence

| Outcome | Acceptance evidence |
|---|---|
| Sign in and consult | A returning owner on supported mobile and desktop browsers reaches a working consultation without connection setup. |
| Genuine useful exchange | Actual separate agent invocations. A test scenario with a material weakness produces a meaningful Critic challenge and response/revision; a sound scenario permits reasoned agreement. Head accurately reflects resolved and unresolved issues. |
| Current evidence | A time-sensitive question produces verified direct sources through the live research path without an explicit research keyword. |
| Quiet interface | No routine protocol paragraphs in the conversation; states are compact, and actionable exceptions explain the next step. |
| Same intelligence settings | Saved and effective provider/model/effort/preset values match the old system; no silent downgrade. |
| Reliable continuity | Mobile reconnect, server restart and Stop tests preserve accepted work and avoid duplicate confirmed responses. |
| Browser voice | A real Ukrainian utterance returns editable text in Safari and Chrome; Stop, Cancel, denial, unavailable-service, network and background states preserve the pre-existing draft and do not send it. |
| Mobile usability | Essential flows work from 320 CSS px upward, with keyboard/touch access, readable reflow and no page-level horizontal scroll. Current Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Edge are release targets, not a claim of support for every historical browser. |

Retain the existing 5-second acknowledgment, 30-second first useful contribution, 60-second stalled-work visibility and ten-minute continuation targets as targets to measure. Do not manufacture filler to meet them or claim that this prototype proves performance.

## GoDaddy replacement boundary

The existing **Personal AI Consulting Group** app and its own database may be erased to make room for the later replacement, as explicitly allowed by the owner. No other GoDaddy app, database, shared table or credential is authorized for removal. This phase performs no deletion. The deployment phase must confirm the exact app/database ownership boundary and preserve the required model configuration before any reset. [Deployment boundary](deployment-boundary.md) records the current evidence and what remains unknown.

## Design inputs and open evidence

Design materials are supplied: the rejected existing `prototype/`, old Candidate B files, settings UI and the owner’s explicit corrections. They establish what to avoid, not an approved visual baseline. Remove the decorative “Room for a different point of view” slogan and “Your space” label. The initial three different full-product directions have been presented. The owner requested a combined direction: black theme; Ember message formatting and Discussion/Outcome/Sources tabs; Cobalt chat/composer geometry; microphone icon without adjacent Voice text; a persistently visible Send button. Three expressive agent-colour palettes were shown within that shared composition; the owner selected Electric, then requested the brand and colour refinements recorded above. Those revisions preceded the explicit whole-design acceptance of Electric A v8 on 14 September 2026. All need a standard floating desktop navigation bar and a mobile hamburger menu. “Floating” is interpreted as a bar that remains available while scrolling, without arbitrary dragging. Remove New conversation from desktop and hamburger navigation. Keep New in Conversations and add a New action above the chat where Review states previously sat. Review states is a development-only inspection feature and is absent from the app; any prototype inspection controls remain outside the normal app view. No additional design materials are required or assumed. The [initial interactive prototype](../prototype/index.html) is rejected historical material with fictional data. The [current candidate inventory](../README.md#compare-the-three-designs) is a later review reference, not an upstream source of product intent. Current candidates simulate interactions without AI calls, authentication or database writes. Codex is the selected executor. The owner accepted Electric A v8 with “OK. Design accepted.” on 14 September 2026 and requested continuation of the SDD workflow through post-approval planning. This does not authorize implementation. The exact visual authority belongs to the design brief; the approval event is retained in `forge/design/evidence/electric-v8-approval-20260914.json`.

Sources: the owner's current request and explicit design-first answer; their 14 September confirmation that the Ukrainian voice probe works in both Safari and Chrome; their explicit decision to retain image attachments only because this is a single-owner system and they will upload images they generated; old `docs/product-idea.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, related documents and current code at `49c7ad9a0b3033e9437e79cd98ed5d35e71cfced`; the source-backed [review](review.md) and [model preservation record](model-settings.md). The prior implementation and historical reports establish evidence, not authorization to expand this phase. Working language is English from the latest substantive request; product conversations retain the user's language behavior, including Ukrainian and English.

The Mac browser probe confirmed the `uk-UA` language setting and successful owner speech result in current Safari and Chrome. Mobile Safari and Android Chrome remain release checks; a desktop result does not prove them. Other open evidence is limited to the current saved model snapshot, supported provider reauthorization and GoDaddy runtime/storage/streaming verification for the later implementation. The simpler architecture is a later proposal in [architecture.md](architecture.md), not an intake prerequisite or production readiness.
